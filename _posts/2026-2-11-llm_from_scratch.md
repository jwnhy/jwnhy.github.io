title: LLM from Scratch (TinyLLaMA)
---

## Introduction

I've been wanting to learn about the LLM for quite a long time, but didn't have
the time to do so until now. So, I decided to implement a simple LLM using my
way of learning, which is to implement it from scratch.

### Ground Rules

I have set some ground rules for myself to follow while implementing the LLM:

- No wheels: I will implement everything (except basic ops like `matmul`) from scratch.
- Understand math, not code: I will study the math behind the LLM.
